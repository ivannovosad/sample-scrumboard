Sidebar on dashboard:
  show what people are currently working on
  set one developer as responsible for all tasks on story

Scrumboard
  click to toggle visibility of responsible
  edit task (responsible, time left)
  
  after dragging: Reload card html with data from server (hrs left may have changed)
  'view notes' link on each card if it has notes

Overall
  sort of keep track of state. Mark dashboard/scrumboard as 'dirty' if changes has been made and reload automatically when switching views
